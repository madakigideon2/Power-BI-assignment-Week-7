In week 7, i started by getting the power BI on my system
After which i imported the data i was given from excel into the power BI
I cleaned the data by removing blank rows and the grand total column which i didn't need for this analysiS.
I used the power queries on the power BI and from there after i applied all changes, i built my dashboard for my report on the power BI.
